      <h1>Network security defined</h1>
      <p>At a foundational level, network security is the operation of protecting data, applications, devices, and systems that are connected to the network.

        Though network security and cybersecurity overlap in many ways, network security is most often defined as a subset of cybersecurity. Using a traditional “castle-and-moat analogy,” or a perimeter-based security approach – in which your organization is your castle, and the data stored within the castle is your crown jewels – network security is most concerned with the security within the castle walls.
        
        In this perimeter-based scenario, the area within the castle walls can represent the IT infrastructure of an enterprise, including its networking components, hardware, operating systems, software, and data storage. Network security protects these systems from malware/ransomware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, network intrusions, and more, creating a secure platform for users, computers, and programs to perform their functions within the IT environment.
        
        As organizations move to hybrid and multicloud environments, their data, applications, and devices are being dispersed across locations and geographies. Users want access to enterprise systems and data from anywhere and from any device. Therefore, the traditional perimeter-based approach to network security is phasing out. A zero-trust approach to security, wherein an organization never trusts and always verifies access, is fast becoming the new method for strengthening an organization’s security posture.
        
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Types of Network Security</h1>
    <ul>
    <li style="color: black;">Firewall protection:
        A firewall is either a software program or a hardware device that prevents unauthorized users from accessing your network, stopping suspicious traffic from entering while allowing legitimate traffic to flow through. There are several types of firewalls with different levels of security, ranging from simple packet-filtering firewalls to proxy servers to complex, next-generation firewalls that use AI and machine learning to compare and analyze information as it tries to come through.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Intrusion detection and prevention:
            Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can be deployed directly behind a firewall to provide a second layer of defense against dangerous actors. Usually working in tandem with its predecessor, the more passive intrusion defense system (IDS), an IDPS stands between the source address and its destination, creating an extra stop for traffic before it can enter a network. An advanced IDPS can even use machine learning and AI to instantly analyze incoming data and trigger an automated process – such as sounding an alarm, blocking traffic from the source, or resetting the connection – if it detects suspicious activity.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Network access control (NAC):
            Standing at the frontline of defense, network access control does just that: it controls access to your network. Most often used for “endpoint health checks,” NAC can screen an endpoint device, like a laptop or smart phone, to ensure it has adequate anti-virus protection, an appropriate system-update level, and the correct configuration before it can enter. NAC can also be programmed for “role-based access,” in which the user’s access is restricted based on their profile so that, once inside the network, they can only access approved files or data.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Cloud security:
            Cloud security protects online resources – such as sensitive data, applications, virtualized IPs, and services – from leakage, loss, or theft. Keeping cloud-based systems secure requires sound security policies as well as the layering of such security methods as firewall architecture, access controls, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), data encryption or masking, threat-intelligence software, and disaster recovery programs.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):
            A virtual private network (VPN) is software that protects a user’s identity by encrypting their data and masking their IP address and location. When someone is using a VPN, they are no longer connecting directly to the internet but to a secure server which then connects to the internet on their behalf. VPNs are routinely used in businesses and are increasingly necessary for individuals, especially those who use public wifi in coffeeshops or airports. VPNs can protect users from hackers, who could steal anything from emails and photos to credit card numbers to a user’s identity.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Data loss prevention (DLP):
            Data loss prevention (sometimes called “data leak prevention”) is a set of strategies and tools implemented to ensure that endpoint users don’t accidentally or maliciously share sensitive information outside of a corporate network. Often put in place to comply with government regulations around critical data (such as credit card, financial or health information), DLP policies and software monitor and control endpoint activities on corporate networks and in the cloud, using alerts, encryption, and other actions to protect data in motion, in use, and at rest.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Endpoint protection:
            Often requiring a multi-layered approach, endpoint security involves protecting all of the endpoints – laptops, tablets, smartphones, wearables, and other mobile devices – that connect to your network. Although securing endpoints is a complex endeavor, a managed security service can help keep your devices, data, and network safe using antivirus software, data loss prevention, encryption, and other effective security measures.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Unified threat management (UTM):
            With UTM appliances, organizations can reduce costs and improve the manageability of network protection and monitoring using multiple network-security tools such as firewalls, VPNs, IDS, web-content filtering, and anti-spam software.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Secure web gateway:
            This security technology prevents unauthorized network traffic from entering the internal network and protects users and employees that may access malicious websites that contain viruses or malware. Secure web gateways typically include web-filtering technology and security controls for web applications.</li>
    </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h1>How does network security work?</h1>
        <p>At its most fundamental level, secure networking centers on two basic tenets: authentication and authorization. In other words, first you need to make sure that every user in your network is an authentic user that is permitted to be there, and then you need to make sure that each user within your network is authorized to access the specific data that they are accessing.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Network security basics</h1>
            <p>Network security involves everything from setting and enforcing enterprise-wide policies and procedures, to installing software and hardware that can automatically detect and block network security threats, to hiring network security consultants and staff to assess the level of network protection you need and then implement the security solutions required.</p>
